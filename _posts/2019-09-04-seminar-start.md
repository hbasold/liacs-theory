The new semester has started and that means we also start with the seminar
again.
We will try a new format: 15 minutes talk with the possibility of an extensive
discussion at the end.
Our idea is that the content has to be rather accessible and that the focus is
on sharing new ideas, presenting open problems and generally interacting with
each other.

The seminar will take every other week at 2pm, starting on 9 September.
Here is a list of dates and rooms, all in the Snellius building, until the
end of this year.

* 9 Sept, 413
* 23 Sept, 401
* 07 Oct, 401
* 21 Oct, 401
* 04 Nov, 402
* 18 Nov, 402
* 02 Dec, 402
* 16 Dec, 402

We wish you all a good start into the new semester and hope to see you at
the seminar.

Alfons and Henning
