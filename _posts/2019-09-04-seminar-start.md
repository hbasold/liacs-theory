The new semester has started and that means we also start with the seminar
again.
We will try a new format: 15 minutes talk with the possibility of an extensive
discussion at the end.
Our idea is that the content has to be rather accessible and that the focus is
on sharing new ideas, presenting open problems and generally interacting with
each other.

Note that the talk should be *planned* for 15 minutes and discussions during
the talk are of course encouraged.
Also note that we practice talks of different length and long talks about
projects (PhD etc.) can also be held.
Just let us know in advance.

The seminar will take every other week at 2pm, starting on 9 September,
alternating the our exchange meetings about general affairs (Theory Café).
Here is a list of dates and rooms, all in the Snellius building, until the
end of this year.
