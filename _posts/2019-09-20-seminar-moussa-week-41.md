Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are considered as near-term applications of
hardware in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum,
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862>) era.
One goal of quantum computing is to design algorithms with possible advantages
over best classical methods.
The Quantum Approximate Optimization algorithm was designed in this context for
approximate optimization.
We try to find for the moment, if there is an advantage, where it is possible
to have one compared to the best classical algorithm.
